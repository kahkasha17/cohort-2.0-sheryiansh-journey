## 🔮 Next Steps

- **Add scroll animations** using **GSAP** or **AOS.js** — enhance entrance/scroll effects for sections and cards to improve engagement.  
- **Include a blog section or CMS integration** (e.g., Netlify CMS, Contentful, or a simple Markdown-based blog) — for posting case studies and updates.  
- **Create a light/dark mode toggle** using CSS variables (custom properties) + a small JS switch to persist user preference.  
- **Add form functionality for the contact section** — client-side validation + connect to EmailJS or a backend (Node/Express or serverless function) to send messages.
